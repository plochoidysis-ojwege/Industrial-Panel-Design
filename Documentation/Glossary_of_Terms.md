# Glossary of Terms

This document contains a growing list of industry-specific terms and acronyms encountered during my training in industrial panel design. Each term is defined clearly to serve as a quick reference guide.

## Terms and Definitions
- **EPLAN:**
  A software tool used for electrical design and documentation, widely adopted in the industry for creating schematics, layouts, and control panel designs.
- **MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker):**
 An electromechanical device that protects an electrical circuit from overcurrent, often used in domestic and small commercial applications.
- **MCCB (Molded Case Circuit Breaker):**  
  A protective device designed to interrupt current flow when an overload or short circuit occurs, commonly used in industrial and commercial electrical systems.
- **CT (Current Transformer):**
A type of transformer used to measure Alternating Current(AC)
- **kVA (kilo-Volt-Ampere):**
Unit for apparent power, commonly used for rating generators and transformers.
- **Macros (EPLAN):**
Reusable blocks of schematics, panels, or logic in EPLAN that can be inserted into multiple projects to save time and ensure consistency.

- **RCD (Residual Current Device):**  
  A safety device that detects imbalances between live and neutral currents (earth leakage) and disconnects the circuit to prevent electric shocks.

- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller):**  
  An industrial computer used to control machinery and processes on production lines, automating operations and improving efficiency.

- **HMI (Human-Machine Interface):**  
  A dashboard or interface that allows operators to interact with and control industrial systems, displaying real-time data and statuses.

- **SLD (Single-Line Diagram):**  
  A simplified representation of an electrical system that uses single lines and standardized symbols to illustrate the interconnections among components.

- **MLD (Multi-Line Diagram):**  
  A detailed diagram showing electrical circuits with multiple lines to represent different phases or components, providing an in-depth view of complex systems.

- **BOM (Bill of Materials):**  
  A comprehensive list detailing all the components, parts, and materials required for building a product, including quantities and specifications.

- **PFC (Power Factor Correction):**  
  Techniques or equipment used to adjust the power factor of electrical systems, ensuring efficient energy usage by reducing the phase difference between voltage and current.
- **RMS Voltage:** The effective value of an AC voltage, equivalent to the DC voltage that would produce the same power.
- **Power Factor (cos Ï†):** The ratio of real power (kW) to apparent power (kVA), indicating the efficiency of power usage.
