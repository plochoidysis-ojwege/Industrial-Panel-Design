- **kVA (kilo-Volt-Ampere):**
Unit for apparent power, commonly used for rating generators and transformers.
- **Macros (EPLAN):**
Reusable blocks of schematics, panels, or logic in EPLAN that can be inserted into multiple projects to save time and ensure consistency.

- **RCD (Residual Current Device):**  
  A safety device that detects imbalances between live and neutral currents (earth leakage) and disconnects the circuit to prevent electric shocks.

- **HMI (Human-Machine Interface):**  
  A dashboard or interface that allows operators to interact with and control industrial systems, displaying real-time data and statuses.

- **SLD (Single-Line Diagram):**  
  A simplified representation of an electrical system that uses single lines and standardized symbols to illustrate the interconnections among components.

- **MLD (Multi-Line Diagram):**  
  A detailed diagram showing electrical circuits with multiple lines to represent different phases or components, providing an in-depth view of complex systems.

- **BOM (Bill of Materials)/Bill of Quantity(B.O.Q):**  
  A comprehensive list detailing all the components, parts, and materials required for building a product, including quantities and specifications.

- **PFC (Power Factor Correction):**  
  Techniques or equipment used to adjust the power factor of electrical systems, ensuring efficient energy usage by reducing the phase difference between voltage and current.
- **RMS Voltage:** The effective value of an AC voltage, equivalent to the DC voltage that would produce the same power.
- **Power Factor (cos φ):** The ratio of real power (kW) to apparent power (kVA), indicating the efficiency of power usage.
- **PIR (Passive Infrared Sensor):**  
  A sensor that detects motion by measuring changes in infrared radiation, commonly used in security systems and automatic lighting.
- **SMPS (Switched-Mode Power Supply):**  
  A type of power supply that uses switching regulators to convert electrical power efficiently, often used in electronic devices to provide stable voltage and current.
- **DMM (Digital Multimeter):**  
  A versatile electronic measuring instrument used to measure voltage, current, resistance, and other electrical parameters.
- **DIN Rail:**  
  A standardized metal rail used for mounting circuit breakers, relays, and other electrical devices in control panels, ensuring organized and secure installation.
- **Terminal Block:**
  A modular, insulated block that secures and connects multiple wires or cables, facilitating organized wiring in control panels and electrical systems.
- **Latching Relay:**
  A type of relay that maintains its state (open or closed) after being activated, even after the power is removed, commonly used in applications requiring memory of the last state.
- **Contactor:**
  An electrically controlled switch used to control high-power circuits, often used in motor control applications to switch power on and off.
- **Continuity Test:**
  A test performed to check if there is a complete electrical path in a circuit, ensuring that all connections are secure and functioning properly.
- **Dead Test:**
  A test conducted on a circuit without applying power, used to verify the integrity of wiring and components before energizing the system.
- **Live Test:**
  A test performed on a circuit with power applied, used to observe the actual operation of the system and ensure all components function as intended.
- **Ferrules:**
  Small metal tubes used to terminate stranded wires, providing a secure and reliable connection to terminal blocks and other connectors.
- **Panel Trunking:**
  A system of conduits or channels used to route and protect electrical cables within a control panel, ensuring organized and safe wiring.
- **Fill Factor:**
  The ratio of the total cross-sectional area of all cables within a trunking system to the available space, used to ensure adequate heat dissipation and ease of installation.
- **Notch:**
  Cut-outs or openings in panels/dividers to allow cables to pass through, requiring smooth edges to prevent insulation damage.
- **Washers (Flat, Spring, Toothed):**
  Various types of washers used to distribute load, prevent loosening, and ensure good electrical contact, especially for grounding.
 
- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller):**  
  An industrial digital computer designed for the control and automation of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines or robotic devices. PLCs are robust, modular, and programmable to handle a wide range of input and output devices.

- **Sourcing (PNP):**  
  A wiring method where the device provides (sources) current to the load. In a sourcing input, the input terminal supplies positive voltage to the circuit when activated. Commonly used in European and Asian automation systems.

- **Sinking (NPN):**  
  A wiring method where the device receives (sinks) current from the load. In a sinking input, the input terminal connects to ground (0V) when activated. Commonly used in North American automation systems.


- **I/O (Input/Output):**  
  Refers to the signals or data sent to (input) or received from (output) a PLC or other control device.

- **TIA Portal:**  
  Siemens’ engineering software platform for configuring, programming, and maintaining automation devices such as PLCs and HMIs.

- **EcoStruxure Control Expert (formerly Unity Pro):**  
  Schneider Electric’s software for programming and configuring their PLCs.
