# Session Notes - 10th June 2025

## Overview
This session focused on EPLAN features, project workflows, and practical applications such as load analysis, BOM generation, and automatic lighting control systems.

## Agenda
- EPLAN features: SLD/MLD creation, BOM generation, and templates.
- Case study: Lighting and control panel for MMU.
- Research topics: Fluorescent tube power consumption and power distribution.

## Key Topics
1. **EPLAN Features:**
   - **SLD and MLD:**
     - Single-Line Diagram (SLD) and Multi-Line Diagram (MLD) creation.
     - Correct symbols and schematic data for devices like ABB 1600A TP MCCB.
     - Integration of images and CAD files for enhanced documentation.
   - **Templates:**
     - Path for templates: `C:\Users\Public\EPLAN\Delta\Template\Company Name`.
     - Importance of using templates for consistency and efficiency.
   - **Bill of Materials (BOM):**
     - Essential for load analysis and breaker selection.
     - Helps in procurement and inventory management.

2. **Case Study: Lighting and Control Panel for MMU:**
   - **Objective:** Design a lighting control system to improve energy efficiency.
   - **Components:**
     - Signage and security lights with sensing mechanisms.
     - Automatic lighting control system for classrooms and hallways.
   - **Analysis:**
     - Circuit representation (hand-drawn and CAD).
     - Equipment rating and load analysis.
   - **The structure and the circuits**
      - The General arrangement
