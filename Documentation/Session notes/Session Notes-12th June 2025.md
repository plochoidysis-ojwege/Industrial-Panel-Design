# Session Notes - 12th June 2025

## Overview
This session introduced a practical project on water tank level control systems and discussed the power distribution hierarchy.

## Agenda
- Practical project: Level control for water tanks.
- Power distribution hierarchy: MDB, SMDB, and Sub-DB.

## Key Topics
1. **Practical Project: Water Tank Level Control System:**
   - **Objective:** Design a system to maintain water levels automatically.
   - **Components:**
     - Sensors: Float switches or ultrasonic sensors.
     - Controller: Processes signals and activates pumps/valves.
     - Pumps/Valves: Adjust water levels based on sensor input.
   - **Power Flow Diagram:**

2. **Power Distribution Hierarchy:**
   - **Main Distribution Board (MDB):**
     - Primary power source for the facility.
   - **Sub-Main Distribution Board (SMDB):**
     - Distributes power to specific areas or departments.
   - **Sub-Distribution Board (Sub-DB):**
     - Final stage of power distribution to individual devices.

## Action Items
- Research the components required for water tank level control systems.
- Study the roles of MDB, SMDB, and Sub-DB in industrial power distribution.
