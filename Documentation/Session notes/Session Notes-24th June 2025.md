This was the first practial session of the Automatic Pump control.The session involved putting the theory into practice by designing a control panel for an automatic pump control system. The session aimed to provide hands-on experience in creating a functional control panel design, including the selection of components and the layout of the control system.
## the process involved:
1. **Designing the control panel layout and the circuit diagram:**
   - As already discussed in this repository, this is a crucial step, designing the layout and circuit diagram helps to visualize the entire system and ensures that all components are properly integrated.This part had already been done in the previous session, so we just had to review it.
2. **Selecting the appropriate components:**
   - Choosing the right components is essential for the functionality and reliability of the control panel. This includes selecting the correct relays, contactors, sensors, and other necessary components based on the requirements of the automatic pump control system.
3. **Mounting and wiring of the components:**
   - Mounting was the next step after getting the right components.I learnt how to mount the components on the panel.The MCB, relays(TWO) and the terminals were mounted on the panel, ensuring that they are securely fixed and properly aligned for easy access and maintenance as shown in the image below:

   The continuity test was perfomed even before wiring to ensure that all components were functioning correctly and that there were no short circuits or open connections. This step is crucial to avoid potential issues during the operation of the control panel.
4. **Wiring the components:**
   - Proper wiring practices were emphasized to ensure safe and reliable connections between components. This included using the correct wire gauges, color coding, and labeling for easy identification and troubleshooting.
   The correct terminals were used was already discussed in the previous session, so we just had to review it.Below are the terminals used:
Again continuity test was performed after wiring to ensure that all connections were secure and functioning as intended. This step is crucial to avoid potential issues during the operation of the control panel.The NC terminals and NO terminals were used as follows:
   - **NC (Normally Closed) Terminals:** Used for connections that should remain closed until a specific condition is met, such as when the pump is not running.
   - **NO (Normally Open) Terminals:** Used for connections that should remain open until a specific condition is met, such as when the pump is activated.
   - **COM (Common) Terminals:** Used as a common connection point for both NC  and NO terminals, allowing for flexibility in circuit design.

   5. **Dead test(no power applied):**
   - A dead test was performed to check the integrity of the wiring and the functionality of the components without applying power to the system. This included verifying the continuity of all connections and ensuring that there were no short circuits or open circuits present.

   - The session ended , next will be the live test with power applied to the system, where we will observe the actual operation of the automatic pump control system and make any necessary adjustments based on the performance observed during the live test.After the test, we will deal with the main thing now( the tanks,the pumps and the sensors) and how to connect them to the control panel.
