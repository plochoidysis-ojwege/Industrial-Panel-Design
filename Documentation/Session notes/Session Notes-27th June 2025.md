# Session Notes – 27th June 2025

## Automatic Water Level Control Project – Completion & Testing

### Continuation from 24th June
- **Previous Progress (24th June):**
  - Completed mounting and wiring of all panel components.
  - Performed a thorough dead test (continuity, insulation, and wiring verification without power).
- **Live Testing (27th June):**
  - Connected power sources (SMPSs) to the panel, motor, and sensors (LSL01, LSH, LSL02, etc.).
  - Verified correct operation:
    - Sensors detected water levels as designed.
    - Pump activated/deactivated according to sensor inputs.
    - Buzzer provided alerts for specific conditions (e.g., low/high water level).
  - No wiring errors or malfunctions observed.
  - Session documented with videos and photos.

### Project Completion
- Successful live test marked the completion of the water level control project.
  [Verification]()
  
- All design objectives met; system functioned reliably.

## Introduction to PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)

### Topics Discussed
- **PLC Brands:** Siemens, Schneider, Allen-Bradley, Mitsubishi, etc.
- **Selection Criteria:** Application, support, compatibility,reliabity,functionality.
- **Input Types:** Sinking and sourcing (NPN/PNP) explained.
- **Programming Software:** Siemens uses TIA Portal. (Research: What does Schneider use? Possible: EcoStruxure Control Expert/SoMachine.)
- **General Concepts:** PLC architecture, I/O types, industrial applications.

## Next Steps / Action Items
- Research Schneider PLC programming software.
- Organize and archive project documentation (photos/videos).
- Plan for hands-on PLC programming in future sessions.
