# Session Notes - 4th June 2025

## Overview
A technical session covering software installation and a project case study focused on mitigating energy loss at Multimedia University of Kenya.

## Agenda
- Software Installation & Configuration  
- Introduction to SLD and MLD diagrams  
- Case Study Discussion: Energy Loss Mitigation  
- Custom Device Symbols and Engineering Concepts

## Key Topics
1. **Software Installation:**  
   - Steps to install and configure the required software  
   - Clarification of UI elements like the "property window"

2. **Project Case Study:**  
   - Objective: Design a project to mitigate energy loss  
   - Key elements:  
     - What makes motors rotate (or not) in two phases  
     - Use of CTs and their importance

3. **Diagrams & Schematics:**  
   - Sample SLD Diagram:
