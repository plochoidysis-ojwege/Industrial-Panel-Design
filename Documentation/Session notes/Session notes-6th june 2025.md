# Session Notes - 6th September 2025

## Overview
This session focused on wiring color codes, Kenyan electrical standards, and research topics related to cables and permutations.

## Agenda
- Wiring color codes (harmonized and Kenyan standards).
- Research topics: Types of cables and their applications.
- Introduction to permutations in electrical systems.

## Key Topics
1. **Wiring Color Codes:**
   - **Harmonized Standards:**
     - International standards for wiring color codes, aligning with IEC and BS 7671.
     - Common color codes:
       - **Live (Phase):** Brown
       - **Neutral:** Blue
       - **Earth (Ground):** Green/Yellow
   - **Kenyan Standards:**
     - Kenyan wiring color codes align with harmonized European and UK standards.
     - Used for both residential and industrial installations.

2. **Research Topics:**
   - **Types of Cables:**
     - Explore different cable types (e.g., armoured cables, flexible cables, high-voltage cables).
     - Applications in industrial and residential settings.
   - **Permutation in Electrical Systems:**
     - Study the arrangement and combination of electrical components to optimize system performance.
     - Examples include load balancing and phase sequencing.
