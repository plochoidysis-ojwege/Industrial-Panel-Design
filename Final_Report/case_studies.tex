\subsection{Automatic lighting control at Multimedia University of Kenya}
This case study explores the design of an automatic lighting control panel to reduce energy loss, which is caused by lighting being ON when they are no longer needed. Such practices can lead to significant energy waste and increased operational costs. The project involved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Creating detailed schematics for control panels housing relays, contactors, and control circuitry.
    \item Utilizing CTs for energy savings verification.
    \item Selecting energy-efficient lighting fixtures and smart relays.
\end{itemize}
The proposed system aims to ensure lights are only active when and where needed, based on occupancy and ambient light levels. This approach reduces electricity costs and promotes sustainability.
