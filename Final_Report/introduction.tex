\chapter{Introduction}
The field of electrical and control engineering is evolving rapidly, driven by advancements in design software and automation systems. Industrial panel design, an essential component in automation, now leverages tools like EPLAN to streamline and enhance the planning, production, and maintenance of electrical systems.

This report documents my industrial attachment experience, providing a comprehensive overview of both theoretical foundations and hands-on applications encountered during the placement. The initial chapters review the key principles and standards in electrical engineering that underpin modern panel design. Later sections detail the practical implementations and case studies that illustrate cutting-edge solutions and best practices in the industry.

By integrating software documentation, design case studies, and practical experiments, this report reflects not only the technical challenges but also the strategic insights gained during the attachment. It is intended as a resource for both academic and professional audiences seeking to understand the intersection of theory, software tools, and real-world engineering applications.
