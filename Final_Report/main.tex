\begin{abstract}
    This report details the industrial attachment experience in industrial panel design and automation systems, with a focus on mastering EPLAN software. Covers fundamental electrical engineering principles, design software applications, practical case studies, and hands-on assembly insights gained during the training program with Engineer Edgar and the collaborating entities. The attachment served to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical skills essential for electrical and electronics engineering professionals.

% Make sure the paths are correct (e.g., if you have them in a 'sections' subfolder)
% If your .tex files are directly in the same folder as main.tex, you don't need 'sections/'
% Based on your screenshot, they appear to be in the same root level as main.tex, so no 'sections/' prefix is needed here initially.
