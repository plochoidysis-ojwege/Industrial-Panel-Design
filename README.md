## Portfolio Overview
This portfolio is designed to provide a structured overview of my work in industrial panel design. It includes detailed documentation, project files, and resources that demonstrate my capabilities in this area.
### Objectives and Scope
- **Objective:** 
  - To gain solid, practical skills in industrial panel design and electrical control systems.
  - To master the use of EPLAN software (EPLAN Electric P8, Fusion 360, EPLAN Pro Panel) as a powerful industry tool for efficient design documentation (schematics, layouts, BOMs)

  - To bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, and explore the convergence of telecom and industrial control systems.
  - To build a comprehensive portfolio of design projects and practical work, showcasing acquired skills and problem-solving abilities in a real-world industrial context.
- **Scope:**
  - It covers from the fundamentals of engineering design e.g design principles and introduction to electrical power and control equipment such as MCCB's relay, contactors , timers e.t.c. Includes troubleshooting, fault finding, maintenance and system tests.
  -  Design software introduction(ECAD); software setup, installation and callibration, using it to create single line diagrams(SLD),multiple line diagrams(MLD),layouts,parts management and macros
  -  Engineering Systems Design (case studies); interpretation of electrical schematics, power and protection design, controls design(both descrete and controller-PLC).Includes working with power schematic circuits(motor starters , PLCs, change-overs , PFC, etc). One case study here is to design a project that mitigates energy loss in the Multimedia University of Kenya)
  -  Practical sessions; Involves electrical and control assembly resources (cct breakers , contactors,relays, PLCs, cables , terminal blocks) provided by ISA Automation , and metal works and fabrication resources (metal sheet , welding machines ,electrical assembly materrials) provided by Bontec Innovation Ltd.. Dropbox draughtsman contributes documentation(layouts,schematics and Bill of Materials) and design software EPLAN Electric P8, Fusion 360, and EPLAN Pro panel.
