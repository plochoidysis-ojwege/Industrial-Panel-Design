## Portfolio Overview
This portfolio is designed to provide a structured overview of my work in industrial panel design. It includes detailed documentation, project files, and resources that demonstrate my capabilities in this area.
### Objectives and Scope
- **Objective:** 
  - To gain solid, practical skills in industrial panel design and electrical control systems.
  - To master the use of EPLAN software (EPLAN Electric P8, Fusion 360, EPLAN Pro Panel) as a powerful industry tool for efficient design documentation (schematics, layouts, BOMs).
  - To fulfill the requirements of my industrial attachment, as approved by Mr. Valentine Siyoi.
  - As an Electrical and Electronics (Telecom Major) student, to broaden my understanding of industrial automation, bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, and explore the convergence of telecom and industrial control systems.
  - To build a comprehensive portfolio of design projects and practical work, showcasing acquired skills and problem-solving abilities in a real-world industrial context.
- **Scope:** Describe the range of materials covered including design projects, documentation, and related resources.
